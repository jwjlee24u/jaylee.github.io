							<h3>Tellling, the audio diary service</h3>
							<p>
								<br>Formed a team called A4 under common interest on solving the problem in the recording daily life globally.								
							</p>
							<span class="image fit"><img src="../images/ipd_al.gif" alt="" /></span>
							<p>
								Problem
								<br>"Tellling" is the audio diary service that brings the value for people not to miss the opportunity of recording daily life due to the amount of time and resources needed by utlizing the audio recording feature. 
								<br>Yet, audio recording has certain problems:
								<br> 1. Awkwardness of talking myself to phone
								<br> 2. Difficulty of looking for the previous recording with specific texts
								<br> 3. Voice heterogenity between real and recorded voice that makes uncomforatble to listen the recordings back. 
							</p>
							<span class="image fit"><img src="../images/ipd_al.gif" alt="" /></span>
							<p>
								Final Solution 
								<br>
								"Tellling", the audio dairy service includes service as follows:
								<br>1.Recording will be just like talking to the audio responsive character "Ling Ling"
								<br>2.STT & Keywords settings for better accessiblity of the recorded data
								<br>3.Voice decoration function to remove the heterogenity
							</p>

							<p>
								Target Market (Playing a Winning Game) 
								<br>
								Global Student Traveling Market(such as Trip, Study Abroad, Working Holidays, Internship and more)
								<br> -> As exchange student program requires the reflection of daily life as a report of the program, the students will need to record their daily life. Plus, traveling student will likely to have higher wants of recording daily life than other students as well. 
								<br> Launch the service in Chinese speaking countries, then, Japan and Thailand, and finally globe.
